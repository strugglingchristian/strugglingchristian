## Examining how 1844 could be the Second Coming, Cleansing of the Heavenly Sanctuary or a Nonevent

  In Douglas Adams’ popular sci-fi novel titled The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a group of highly intelligent beings developed a supercomputer named Deep Thought, in order to determine the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. In the story, it takes Deep Thought 7 ½ million years to compute the answer which just happens to be a seemingly random number, 42. If only the answer to all the questions about life is this simple and can be calculated by a computer, it would certainly solve a lot of our problems.

 Science fiction aside, there has been a much awaited event by Christians all over the world for over two millennia since the resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ, and that is the Second Advent. The First Advent of the Messiah has been prophesied in the Scriptures. Jews who believed that Jesus Christ is the Messiah have welcomed the Lord’s arrival and they eventually became known as Christians, while Jews who did not believe in Him died still waiting for the First Advent of the Messiah. In the First Advent, there were many signs and prophecies scattered throughout Scriptures and even the Magi, who were not Jews were able to read the signs and guided by the Holy Spirit using the Star of Bethlehem, have made their way to worship the Lord. After Jesus' ascension, many of the believers awaited eagerly for His soon return, believing that it would happen in their lifetime. But the hope that they have for Jesus’ soon return did not die with them. They have passed this hope to their children and their children’s children down to our present generation.

  Good thing Jesus did not leave His followers clueless and left them many signs of His return. Some of these are:

<em>You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. Matt. 24:6</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
<em>Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of birth pains. Matt. 24:7-8</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
<em>There will be signs in the sun, moon and stars. On the earth, nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea. People will faint from terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world, for the heavenly bodies will be shaken. Luke 21:25-26
</em>
</p>

<p align="justify">
These signs have been visible since the time of the early Christians, and that’s why some people from the time of the apostles began to doubt the second coming of the Lord.

<em>They will say, “Where is this ‘coming’ he promised? Ever since our ancestors died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation. 2 Peter 3:4</em>
