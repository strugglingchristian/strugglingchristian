# 1844 Made Complicated
<h3 color="grey"><em>Examining how 1844 could be the Second Coming, Cleansing of the Heavenly Sanctuary or a Nonevent</em></h3>


In Douglas Adams’ popular sci-fi novel titled The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a group of highly intelligent beings developed a supercomputer named Deep Thought, in order to determine the ***Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything***. In the story, it takes Deep Thought 7 ½ million years to compute the answer which just happens to be a seemingly random number, ***42***. If only the answer to all the questions about life is this simple and can be calculated by a computer, it would certainly solve a lot of our problems.

Science fiction aside, there has been a much awaited event by Christians all over the world for over two millennia since the resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ, and that is the Second Advent. The First Advent of the Messiah has been prophesied in the Scriptures. Jews who believed that Jesus Christ is the Messiah have welcomed the Lord’s arrival and they eventually became known as Christians, while Jews who did not believe in Him died still waiting for the First Advent of the Messiah. In the First Advent, there were many signs and prophecies scattered throughout Scriptures and even the Magi, who were not Jews were able to read the signs and guided by the Holy Spirit using the Star of Bethlehem, have made their way to worship the Lord. After Jesus' ascension, many of the believers awaited eagerly for His soon return, believing that it would happen in their lifetime. But the hope that they have for Jesus’ soon return did not die with them. They have passed this hope to their children and their children’s children down to our present generation. 


Good thing Jesus did not leave His followers clueless and left them many signs of His return. Some of these are:  


<p align="center">
<em>You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. Matt. 24:6</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
<em>Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of birth pains. Matt. 24:7-8</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
<em>There will be signs in the sun, moon and stars. On the earth, nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea. People will faint from terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world, for the heavenly bodies will be shaken. Luke 21:25-26
</em>
</p>

These signs have been visible since the time of the early Christians, and that’s why some people from the time of the apostles began to doubt the second coming of the Lord. 


<p align="center">
<em>They will say, “Where is this ‘coming’ he promised? Ever since our ancestors died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation. 2 Peter 3:4</em>
</p>

The Second Advent is soon. But from a human perspective, Our *"soon”* may be different from God’s *“soon”*. The apostle Peter writes,

<p align="center">
  <em>
    But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day. The Lord is not    slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:8-9
  </em>
 </p>

Sadly, some believers abandoned their faith and did not believe anymore that the Lord would return. Others however, with great zeal have been expecting the Lord and went on to predict His exact return, even down to the very day and hour. Had they remembered Jesus’ words, they would not have done this. Jesus said

<p align="center">
  <em>
    But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Matt 24:36
  </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>
    Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. 
1st Thess. 5:1-2
  </em>
</p>

Throughout history, many people have tried, and failed to predict the exact day of the Lord’s return. These are but a few:

- 1700		Henry Archer
- 1757		Emanuel Swedenborg
- 1844		William Miller
- 1891		Joseph Smith
- 1914		Jehovah's Witnesses
- 2011		Harold Camping

Harold Camping is the one that was fairly recent and has caught a lot of media attention. Harold Camping, through his group Family Radio,  predicted that the end of the world would occur on May 21, 2011 and when it didn’t happen, changed the date to October 21, 2011. Many of his believers donated money, amounting to millions of dollars. Others sold or gave away their properties believing that they will no longer need it but unfortunately, there were also some tragic cases of people killing themselves or their loved ones because of extreme fear or panic as the date drew near. Harold Camping himself died two years later in 2013. Meanwhile, Family Radio administrators have repented of their date setting and Family Radio is still active to this day, just without the date setting. This is the sad reality when people were deluded into believing erroneous date setting for the Lord’s return. What happened to Harold Camping’s believers are eerily similar (except maybe for the cases of killings) to what happened with William Miller and the Millerite movement. And like the supercomputer Deep Thought who computed the answer to the ***Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything***, which is ***42***, we will explore how Miller derived the calculation of the Lord’s return and how he got the result of ***1844***.

  <em>(1782-1849)</em>
</p>

William Miller was born on February 15, 1782, in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. He was a veteran in the American revolution and gained the rank of captain. After the war he became a farmer and took up civil duties such as constable, was elected as deputy sheriff and also served as Justice of the peace. Miller was born a Baptist but later converted to Deism. Deists believe in a Creator God but they also believe that after God created everything, He just left them to do whatever they please because He doesn't care. But after Miller experienced the horrors of war and how he was miraculously saved, Miller then came to believe that God was at work in saving him so he turned back to God and back to the Baptist faith and renounced Deism. William Miller was also an active member of the Freemasons until 1831, but he found it incompatible with the Bible so he left the group. His thorough study of the Bible led him to conclude that the Second Coming would be sometime around 1843. Miller based his calculation primarily on Daniel 8:14 ***“And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.”*** This is the commonly known verse on how Miller got to the year 1843, but this understanding came to him much later. Miller has developed his so-called ***“15 proofs”*** to show how he got to the date but we will discuss this briefly in a little bit.

Miller has no specific date for his prediction but he eventually narrowed down his calculation. According to Miller, *“My principles in brief are, that Jesus Christ will come again to this earth, cleanse, purify, and take possession of the same, with all the saints, sometime between March 21, 1843, and March 21, 1844. <sup>[1]</sup>”* When the dates have passed without the Second Coming, Miller stated publicly, *"I confess my error, and acknowledge my disappointment; yet I still believe that the day of the Lord is near, even at the door. <sup>[2]</sup>"*
